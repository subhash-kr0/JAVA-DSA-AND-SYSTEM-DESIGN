JDBC API
++++++++
=> It is an API given by SUNMS to interact with the database.
=> To interact with the database SUNMS had given a jar called rt.jar which is
available for the programmer during the installation of jdk s/w.
=> To use JDBC in java program we take the support of a package called
"java.sql.*" and "javax.sql.*".
=> API refers to set of rules and guideliness which has interfaces.
=> To get the implementation for these interface abstract methods we need to take
the help of "DB-Vendor".
=> DB-Vendor will give the implementation for "SRS" and release those
implementation classes in the form of "jars" to the java
develop community people.
=> Depending upon the database we use in our project we need to use the respective
jars supplied by "DB-Vendor".

Steps given by SUNMS to interact with Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Load and register the driver
2. Establish the Connection
3. Create Statement/PreparedStatement/CallableStatement to transfer the query.
4. Execute the query
5. Process the result
6. close the resources
7. Handle SQLExceptions if it occurs.












To execute select Query we need to use
public ResultSet executeQuery(String sqlQuery) throws SQLException


To execute non-select query like insert,update,delete we need to use
public int executeUpdate(String sqlNonSelectQuery) throws SQLException













We can write the Query in three ways:
1.Statement
 
PreparedStatement provides better performance than Statement object 

2.Prepared Statement
+++++++++++++++++
PreparedStatement
+++++++++++++++++
 => These statements are used to transfer the query during the compilation only.
 => These statements are also called as Pre-Compiled Query.
 => Performance of these object are high compared to Statement object.
 => In case of PreparedStatement the query will be incomplete and the values will be injected to the query at the runtime.
 => Values to the PreparedStatement object will be injected using setXXXXX(int pos,xxxxx value) throws SQLException method.

3. callable statement:

Statements is used to execute standard SQL queries, PreparedStatement is used to execute bind or dynamic queries, and CallableStatement is used to call the stored procedure from Java.
