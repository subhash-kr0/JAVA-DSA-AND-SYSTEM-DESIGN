DB theory:
When we had data in old days we use to store it in note books or in the record form.
but later as the number of person and data increased we went to excel sheet etc. to store data.

But as the population increased in human mankind we started struggling to store large data in excel so software developers like us came into a picture with a solution of something they call DBMS.(Data BAse Management System).

Company like --->Oracle/Sybase/Microsoft  etc..  started building DBMS software and launced into market.

Before DMBS was only individual concept where you can just store data 


after that software connecting came into picture.

They said that you can establised a connection using your software and you can store the data in our DBMS .

Example:  Banking details/ ticket booking App etc. they will collect data from user using UI and your software will establised a connection and store the data in your DBMS.

here in DBMS === we store data in a form of rows and columns (Table).

Name     Age      DOB              City
vik      22     1-1-2001         Chennai
tilak    20     1-1-2003          Bangalore
nitin    25     1-1-1997           Goa

there was a drawback.
Because it is difficult to maintain the data of a person  in a single row .


So the demand of RDBMS concept came in to the picture (Relational DBMS):

Here the large data is maintain by multiple number of table and that tables are connceted to each other using foreign key and primary key concept.
Id    Name     Age      DOB              City                                CourseId    CourseName      
01    vik      22     1-1-2001         Chennai           RDBMS                   01       Java
02    tilak    20     1-1-2003          Bangalore     ------------>              01       Java 
03    nitin    25     1-1-1997           Goa                                     03       Python



In DBMS we have two concept:

1.RDBMS------SQL.(Structured Query Language)
     Some Software in RDBMS are: MySql/SQLlite/PostSql/Oracle Server.--->98% same 2% changes.

2.NoSQL.
      Some Software which are NoSql are :  MongoDB/Hbase/Cassandra it deals with Big Data concepts here it wont be in a form of tables rather it will be in a (Key-Value,Docs.Graph) etc..

Mostly Java Developer will deals with the concept of RDBMS:

We will use Mysql Software.
 1. It is easy to understand.
 2. Not a case sensitive .
 3. We need to learn only CRUD operation (Query).


Download the Software link---->https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

step1: go to the above link.
step2: select the Operating System as ------> Microsoft Windows.
step3: select second which has more memory like 331.3M.
step4: click on ------> download button.
step5: scroll down the click on -------> No thanks, just start my download.


Now do the setup by the following methods.

we need three things to setup our MYSQL:
1.Server.
2.Workbech.
3.Shell.

step1: Instal and open the UI of your Mysql Installer.
step2: select -----> Custom.
step3: click on MYSQL Servers --> MYSQL Server ---> MySQl Server 8.0.34 ----> MySQl Server 8.0.34-*64  after that click on arrow(->).
step4: Now click on Applications ---> MySQL Workbench 8.0 ----> MySQL Workbench 8.0.34*64  after that click on arrow(->).
step5: Now Click on MySQL Shell --->  MySQL Shell 8.0 ----->  MySQL Shell 8.0.34 *64  after that click on arrow(->).


Once you do all this click on Next.
After that click on Execute. then click on Next---Next 

Now you will reach a UI were you need to setup your MySQL Root Password  = xxxxxxxxxx.
                                                      Repeat Password  = xxxxxxxxxx.  

Once you set the password Click on Next again click on Next --> Finally Click on Execute.  

INSERT INTO studentinfo VALUES(1, 'vikram', 'khandelwal','S', 24, 'Bengaluru');

INSERT INTO studentinfo (id, firstname, middlename, lastname,age, city)
VALUES(1, 'vikram','khandelwal','S', 24, 'Bengaluru');

INSERT INTO studentinfo (id, firstname, lastname,age, city)
VALUES(1, 'vikram','S', 24, 'Bengaluru');
INSERT INTO studentinfo (id, firstname, lastname,age, city)
VALUES(?,?,?,?,?);

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(
id int(5) NOT NULL,
firstname varchar(20) NOT NULL,
middlename varchar(20),
lastname varchar(20)NOT NULL,
salary int(7) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO employee (id, firstname, middlename, lastname,salary)
VALUES(1, 'hyder','abbas','najafi', 28);

CREATE TABLE newStudents(
id int(5) auto_increment primary key,
firstname varchar(20) NOT NULL,
middlename varchar(20),
lastname varchar(20)NOT NULL,
age int(3) NOT NULL
);


select * from studentinfo;

CREATE TABLE newStudents(
id INT(5) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
firstname varchar(20) NOT NULL,
middlename varchar(20),
lastname varchar(20)NOT NULL,
age int(3) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO newstudent1 VALUES(1,'rohan', 'hirani', 'm', 18);

create table Student(
id int(5) PRIMARY KEY,
firstname varchar(40) NOT NULL,
lastname varchar(40) NOT NULL,
age int(3) NOT NULL,
city varchar(20)NOT NULL,
country varchar(20) NOT NULL

)
